Inferring the time that selection favored Neanderthal introgressed alleles in modern human populations: simulations, statistical inference method, imputation of ancient samples, examples

# Overview
This repository contains code associated with [Yair, Lee, and Coop (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.10.04.325183). We provide a brief overview of the contents of each directory below. See those directories and
comments in scripts for more details.

1. **Imputation**: directory 'imputation' contains scripts using Beagle 4.1 to impute genotypes and filter sites
    in ancient populations
2. **Simulations and Method:** We provide scripts showing how we simulated data for
    method validation, in addition to how we run the method on those data.
