This directory contains scripts to describe the demographic history among a set of populations and to list the sample sizes we have for each population. We write scripts to be able to take what we call different versions of demographic histories and options of sample sizes. Each of these scripts saves RData, RDS, and/or ftr files to be used by other scripts.
 
+ Demography (i.e. admixture graph) versions are defined in scripts called version{letter}_demography.R, where {letter} is a letter used to reference a specific admixture graph. Here, we show the demography for version A, versionA_demography.R.
+ Sample size options are defined in a script called sampleSizes_allOptions.R.
